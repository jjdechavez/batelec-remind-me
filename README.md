# Batelec Remind Me

Facebook page web scrape daily.

I'll move this project to Flask python to utilize the fb webscrape.

## Activate venv

Virtual environment to manage dependencies of the project with `. venv/bin/activate` command

## Install dependencies

`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` command

## Run development

Run `flask --app main run` command, to start the server

## TODOS
- [X] Setup Flask as server
- [X] Install facebook_scrapper
- [] Implement Mongodb as database
- [] Store scrape on mongodb
